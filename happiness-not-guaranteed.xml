              <title>Mapping Personalities</title>
              <itunes:subtitle>Do labels like introvert and extrovert or astrological signs truly define us? Vasily and Nikita debate the merit of personality types and classifications.</itunes:subtitle>
              
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Introvert, extrovert, ENFJ, Virgo - do personality types really capture the full essence of who you are? Vasily and Nikita are skeptical. They argue that tricky terms like "introvert" don't even come close to describing whole, complex human beings. Vasily thought he was an introvert for years until he realized he also had plenty of extroverted qualities. He and Nikita point out that people are multifaceted - any given individual can't be neatly boxed into a single category.</p><p>Are personality quizzes like Myers-Briggs real science or just for fun? The hosts of the show say labels like "introvert" or "Leo" barely scratch the surface of who people really are. Vasily thought he was introverted until he realized he's also extroverted sometimes. So he and Nikita doubt these buzzwords describe real, complex individuals.</p><p>While labels can help understand others, don't let them box you in! Though tests are popular distractions, Vasily and Nikita don't think they truly map your whole personality. Tune in as the hosts debate: do we uncover truths or just limit ourselves when we try to define people so neatly?</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12818114-50-popular-beliefs-that-people-think-are-true">Book 50 Popular Beliefs That People Think Are True</a> by Guy P.

              <itunes:subtitle>Ending relationships can be painful but sometimes vital. Vasily and Nikita discuss times when they cut ties and how to know when enough is enough.</itunes:subtitle>
              
              <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, Vasily and Nikita tackle the delicate topic of ending relationships. The conversation is sparked by a personal story of a road trip that resulted in a permanent falling out with another couple. This real-life example sets the stage for a broader discussion on the challenging decisions of cutting ties, especially when influenced by clashing political views and divergent worldviews in today's divisive climate.</p><p>Throughout the episode, the hosts engage in an introspective debate on the balance between self-preservation and the moral responsibility of staying connected. They ponder the fine line between creating a protective echo chamber and the necessity of distancing oneself for mental well-being. True to the podcast's nature, their exchange is raw and honest, mirroring the struggle between the human desire for connection and the essential act of setting boundaries. This episode of "Happy Maybe" resonates with the harsh reality that sometimes, ending relationships, however painful, is crucial for personal growth and happiness.</p>]]></description>

              <title>The Life Coaching Minefield</title>
              <itunes:subtitle>Nikita dislikes the coaching industry, but Vasily sees pros if the coaching raises energy and provides accountability. They discuss how to vet so-called gurus, and debate paid versus freely shared wisdom.</itunes:subtitle>
              
              <description><![CDATA[<p>Nikita thinks most folks selling themselves as life coaches just want your cash. But Vasily says some coaches can help you get motivated to improve your life. Nikita warns about social media influencer types who act like gurus but don’t really know you. Vasily thinks hiring a coach can work if they get you taking action and hold you accountable.</p><p>They tell stories of coaches who were helpful and others who just talked big without delivering. In the end, Nikita and Vasily agree you need to be smart about who you take advice from. Not everyone who seems ultra confident has the answers. The trick is finding a mentor who calls you to be your best self, not just tells you what you want to hear.</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Tim Ward’s YouTube Channel<strong> </strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/@TimothyWard">https://www.youtube.com/@TimothyWard</a></p></li><li><p>Pieter Levels on X (Twitter) <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/levelsio">https://twitter.com/levelsio</a></p></li><li><p>Darren Silver <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.darrensilver.earth/">https://www.darrensilver.earth/</a></p></li></ul>]]></description>
