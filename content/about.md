Vasily and Nikita often engage in conversations that leave them feeling connected
and inspired. Finding solace in their friendship, they discuss meaningful topics,
share personal struggles, and offer honest feedback. Their deep connection led them
to an ideaâ€”to start recording these conversations, hoping to bring comfort to others
who may be facing similar challenges.

The podcast's title captures the elusive nature of happiness, and the hosts firmly
believe that life holds more significance than simply striving for happiness. From
this perspective, they delve into their own lives and experiences.

The core promise of this podcast is honesty. Every episode revolves around topics
that hold deep personal meaning and importance for Vasily and Nikita. Their
conversations flow naturally, often taking unexpected turns, and the hosts
deliberately refrain from trying to arrive at solutions. As a result, some
discussions may appear incomplete, but this approach allows for genuine and
authentic exchanges.
