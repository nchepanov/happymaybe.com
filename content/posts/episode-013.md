<p>Introvert, extrovert, ENFJ, Virgo - do personality types really capture the full essence of who you are? Vasily and Nikita are skeptical. They argue that tricky terms like "introvert" don't even come close to describing whole, complex human beings. Vasily thought he was an introvert for years until he realized he also had plenty of extroverted qualities. He and Nikita point out that people are multifaceted - any given individual can't be neatly boxed into a single category.</p><p>Are personality quizzes like Myers-Briggs real science or just for fun? The hosts of the show say labels like "introvert" or "Leo" barely scratch the surface of who people really are. Vasily thought he was introverted until he realized he's also extroverted sometimes. So he and Nikita doubt these buzzwords describe real, complex individuals.</p><p>While labels can help understand others, don't let them box you in! Though tests are popular distractions, Vasily and Nikita don't think they truly map your whole personality. Tune in as the hosts debate: do we uncover truths or just limit ourselves when we try to define people so neatly?</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12818114-50-popular-beliefs-that-people-think-are-true">Book 50 Popular Beliefs That People Think Are True</a> by Guy P.
