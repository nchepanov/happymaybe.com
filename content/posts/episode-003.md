description: "In this episode of Happy Maybe, Vasily and Nikita engage in a freeform
conversation about the connection between inspiration, discipline, and
our pursuit of happiness. Nikita shares how his recent trip to Costa
Rica inspired him, but his motivation has since waned. Vasily
discusses his personal struggle with maintaining a consistent
meditation practice and suggests reading books as a more mindful
alternative to mindlessly scrolling through social media."
