description: "In this episode of Happy Maybe, Vasily and Nikita engage in a freeform
conversation about the complexities of finding happiness and
satisfaction in a seemingly 'perfect' life. They explore the pressures
of constantly striving for self-improvement and question whether the
pursuit of professional success always leads to happiness. They also
delve into the dilemma of whether to push for a salary raise or accept
the status quo. Join them for a thought-provoking conversation that
challenges our assumptions about what truly matters in life."
