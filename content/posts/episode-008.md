<p>In this episode, Vasily threw Nikita a curveball with a topic that got him thinking. They dove into the unruly world of radical honesty and how it can mess with our relationships. Nikita brought up this idea of "right speech" from Buddhism, which caused Vasily to reflect.</p><p>Without intending to, the two friends turned the episode into an example of how radical honesty can be practiced since Nikita wasnâ€™t a fan of how Vasily introduced the topic. Behind the scenes, they had to have a follow-up conversation ensuring their friendship was still strong after this little disagreement.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Links:</strong></p><ul><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_48_Laws_of_Power">Book 48 Laws of Power</a> (Wikipedia)&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.learnreligions.com/right-speech-450072&nbsp;">Right Speech</a> (on 'Learn Religions') </p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_Silence&nbsp;">Noble Silence in Buddhism</a> (Wikipedia) </p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://circlinginstitute.com/&nbsp;">The practice of Circling</a></p></li><li><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNA5qTTxFFA">Intro to Internal Family Systems</a> (YouTube)&nbsp;</p></li></ul>
